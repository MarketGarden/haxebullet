Native [Bullet 3D Physics](http://bulletphysics.org/) for Haxe.

Testing the webidl approach for HL/C & JS:

## Usage

[Reference](http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Hello_World)

In order to get HL/C build to work you need to add 'haxebullet/cpp/bullet' directory into your build process so the compiler is able to find bullet sources.

In order to get JS build to work you need to add 'haxebullet/js/ammo/ammo.js' script either by embedding or including it with a script tag.
